    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pancakes are an old favorite of mine. I use small-curd, low-fat cottage cheese. They come out thin and delicate, somewhere between a classic pancake and a crepe. A nice addition to a reduced-carb diet.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
        <li>¼ cup blueberries, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Strain cottage cheese in a sieve fitted over a bowl, pressing down occasionally, until cottage cheese has dried out, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a medium bowl; add cottage cheese, flour, melted butter, and salt. Mix until just blended.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat; drop large spoonfuls of batter into the melted butter. Sprinkle blueberries into batter. Cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
